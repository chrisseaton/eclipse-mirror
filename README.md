# Eclipse Release Mirror

This is a mirror of Eclipse binary releases, repackaged, for use in scripting
workflows, CI, etc.

## Repackaging

Binaries from https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/.

Main binary path on Linux is `eclipse/eclipse`, and on macOS
`Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse`. For macOS the DMG is mounted and
a tarball of `Eclipse.app` made.
